        <p class="stats">
        In its <b>3,210 days</b> of life, Thresholderbot
        counted the links in <b>billions of tweets</b> and sent
        <b>2,880,496 emails</b> to its <b>155 brilliant &amp; attractive
        users</b>.
        </p>

        <h2>Wait, what the hell is this?</h2>

        <p>Thresholderbot was a personal software robot that monitored your
        Twitter timeline and sent you an email every time it saw a link more
        than a certain <em>threshold</em> number of times.</p>

        <p>Then, Elon Musk bought Twitter and, in a desparate and misguided
        attempt to drum up revenue to pay back <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/22/elon-musk-twitter-debt">the incredible debt with which
        Twitter was saddled as part of the purchase</a>, shut down the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/07/techscape-elon-musk-twitter-api">free API
        access that allowed Thresholderbot and thousands (millions?) of other
        useful applications to exist <i>and enrich Twitter's value</i></a>.</p>

        <p>(If you're curious, please <a href="https://gist.github.com/mccutchen/3416442743b8ae20a502ae367dba43f9">take a look at some quick and dirty analysis</a>
        of the way Twitter's new API pricing would make Thresholderbot
        prohibitively expensive to operate.)</p>

        <h2>What now?</h2>

        <p>We're shutting down the service, but we're not deleting your
        data.</p>

        <p>We'll soon launch a read-only version of Thresholderbot that will
        allow each user to browse (or download) all of the links that
        Thresholderbot ever sent them.</p>
